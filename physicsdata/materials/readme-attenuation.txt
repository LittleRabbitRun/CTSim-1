All attenuation_*.txt consist of three columns with the
following contents:
1st column: Energy in keV
2nd column: mu/rho in cm^2/g
3rd column: mu_en/rho in cm^2/g

The energy values in the first column were changed,
compared to the original data that was obtained from
http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/tab3.html
and
http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/tab4.html
between 2011-02-14 and 2012-08-22:
The energies are given in keV instead of MeV.

Materials that are preceeded by "AK-" denote materials
whose properties have been computed by Andreas Keil.
